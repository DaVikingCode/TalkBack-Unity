TalkBack-Unity
==============

Detect if Android TalkBack service is running

To use it, import the Plugins folder and inside your code call: `TalkBack.Detect();`.

Note that unfortunately it seems [impossible to manage TalkBack via code](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/eyes-free-dev/yQO7C9lE_x8/9GWtxxXQO6AJ) to activate/deactivate.
